The goal of this study was to compare the gut microbiome richness of mice post-weaning between 1-9 days (Early) and 140-150 days (Late). 

I would definitely expect the Late group to have a greater diversity of species in their gut microbiome compared to the early group since their microbiome was still mostly based on the mother's milk.
